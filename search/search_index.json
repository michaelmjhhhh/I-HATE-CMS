Unique means that there are no rows that are extactly the same.

The non repeating data stays in its own entity and is given a unique identifier (primary key). The primary key from the non-repeating entity is placed in the new entity as a foreign key. In the new entity a unique identifier is found. This will most likely be a composite key. The issue with the first normal form is that the new entity will have attributes that only rely on one part of the key, known as partial key dependencies. This does not align with the normalized database philosophy of the whole key and nothing but the key.</p> </li> <li>Second normal form: The partial key dependencies are removed into their own entity and a primary key is identified. The primary key features in the entity it was removed from as both a primary key and a foreign key at this point. The issue with second normal form is that some attributes in the entities do not rely on the key, they are their own information. These are known as transitive or non-key dependencies. These, again, do not align with the normalized database philosophy of \"the whole key and nothing but the key\".</li> <li> <p>Third normal form:  The transitive or non-key dependencies are moved into their own entity and given a primary key. The primary key becomes a foreign key in the entity it was removed from. Transitive dependencies can be present in any of the entities previously created. Once they are removed, your entities should meet the normalized database philosophy of \"the whole key and nothing but the key\". </p> </li> <li> <p>How to construct from UNF to 1NF to 2NF to 3NF:</p> </li> <li> <ul> <li> <p>Split, to get 1NF</p> </li> <li> <p>Find a composite key, two attributes that can uniquely identify each record/row. \u7136\u540e\u8bf4\u4eba\u8bdd\u5c31\u662f\uff0c\u5224\u65ad\u54ea\u4e9battribute\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6574\u4e2acomposite key\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u627e\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u62c6\u5206\u62102\u4e2a\u8868\u3002\u539f\u672c\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u65b0\u7684attribute\u7ec4\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u8868\uff0c\u8868\u7684PK\u5c31\u662f\u8fd9\u4e9battribute\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u90a3\u4e2a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u540c\u6837\u7684\u90a3\u4e2aattribute\u4f5c\u4e3aFK\u7559\u5728\u539f\u8868\u4e2d\u3002\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u62c6\u5206\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u3002</p> </li> <li> <p>\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5224\u65ad\u54ea\u4e9b\u662fpartial dependent\u7684\uff0c\u5217\u51fa\u6765, \u8fd9\u4e9b\u518d\u6b21\u62c6\u5206\u6210\u5b50\u8868\u3002A partial dependent on B\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u628aB\u8fd9\u4e2aattribute\u7559\u5728\u539f\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3aFK\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u8868\u7684PK\u5c31\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2aattribute\u3002\u65b0\u7684\u8868\u7684\u53e6\u5916\u4e00\u4e2aattribute\u5c31\u662fA\u3002</p> </li> <li> <p></p> </li> <li> <p></p> </li> <li> <p></p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/#a326-construct-a-database-normalized-to-3nf-for-a-range-of-real-world-examples","title":"A3.2.6 Construct a database normalized to 3NF for a range of real-world examples","text":"<p>\u4e66\u4e0a\u4e00\u5806\u5e9f\u8bdd\uff0cA3.2.5\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u638c\u63e1\u4e86\u5c31\u884c</p>"},{"location":"notes/#a327-evaluate-the-need-for-denormalizing-databases","title":"A3.2.7 Evaluate the need for denormalizing databases","text":"<ul> <li>Advantages</li> <li>Simpler and faster queries as the database has to look at fewer entities to collect all the data.</li> <li>Faster data retrieval as the database has fewer joins to complete. </li> <li>Disadvantages</li> <li>More challenging updates and inserts as some of the data is repeated.</li> <li>Updating code can be difficult to write as the data is in multiple places. </li> <li>There may be inconsistencies as there are duplicate copies of data.</li> <li>The fact there are many copies of some data requires more storage.</li> <li>\u8fd9\u4e66\u4e0a\u5199\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u5e9f\u8bdd\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u5c31\u662fdata redundancy\u6216\u8005\u8bf4\u662fduplicated data</li> </ul>"},{"location":"notes/#a331-outline-the-difference-between-data-language-types-within-structured-query-language-sql","title":"A3.3.1 Outline the difference between data language types within structured query language (SQL)","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Data definition language(DDL)</p> </li> <li>is used to create the database structures. </li> <li>It is used to create the schema, the tables, and constraints within the database.
