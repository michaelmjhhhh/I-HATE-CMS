#### About the markdown file "I HATE CMS FINAL"
- I've listed some notes, thoughts, and tips which covered all the contents we've learned so far in CS. It may seems redundant and contains some error, since I didn't check it carefully.
- **Hope this will be a good material for revision.**
- **Feel free to view the file or download it and use Typora or VS Code to render it.** 

- TODO
    - Fixing Image Display Using Relative Paths
